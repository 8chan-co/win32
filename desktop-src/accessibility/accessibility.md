# Accessible Windows apps

This section contains documentation for Windows developers designing accessible applications, assistive technology developers building tools such as screen readers and magnifiers, and software test engineers creating automated scripts for testing Windows applications.

The resources provided here can help you build Windows applications that can be used by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities, personal preferences, environmental considerations, and specific work styles.

## In this section

| Topic | Description |
|-|-|
| [Developing accessible applications for Windows](accessibility-appdev.md) | Each Windows application framework supports numerous accessibility features that make it easier for users with disabilities, personal preferences, or specific work styles to successfully use any Windows device they choose. |
| [Developing accessible UI frameworks for Windows](accessibility-uiframeworkdev.md) | To be usable by as many people as possible, UI frameworks built for the Windows platform should support accessibility features that make it easier for those with disabilities, personal preferences, or specific work styles to use their Windows devices successfully. |
| [Developing assistive technology for Windows](accessibility-atdev.md) | Third-party assistive technology products—such as screen readers, magnifiers and speciality hardware—are essential tools for many users of Windows (and other Microsoft products). |
| [Testing with UI Automation and other tools](accessibility-testwithuia.md) | Testing the accessibility of your Windows applications, assistive technology tools, and UI frameworks is a critical step in ensuring successful user experiences for people with disabilities and other limitations, as well as users who prefer keyboard interactions. |
| [Legacy accessibility and automation technology - MSAA to UI Automation](accessibility-legacy.md) | Windows accessibility and automation consist of two technologies—Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) and Microsoft UI Automation. MSAA is a legacy technology introduced with Windows 95, while UI Automation is a newer, more capable technology that addresses the limitations of MSAA. |
| [Windows accessibility and automation reference](../winauto/about-windows-accessibility-features.md) | The Desktop Win32 APIs provide accessibility and automation features to help developers build applications and UI frameworks, assistive technology vendors build tools, testers ensure quality implementations, and people with disabilities use their computers and devices. |
